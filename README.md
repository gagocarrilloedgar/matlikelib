# matlikelib
Open source library of C++ functions that mimic MATLAB ones

Right now the folder struture is the following:


```
matlikelib
 -- Makefile
 -- matlikelib
 -- other files
 -- /src
    -- /include
        -- .h files // headers and class definition files
    -- main.cpp // Containes the tests of the functions
    -- function defitnitions (.cpp files )
```


## Working MATLAB like functions

- *linspace*: 1D uniform vector distribution generator
- *rad2deg*: convert from radiants to degrees

## To implement
- *deg2rad*: convert from degrees to rad
- *zeros*: creates a ND vector filled of 1's of given it's size
- *transpose*: transport a given ND vector
- *inverse*: create the inverse of a matrix
- *ones*: creates a ND vector filled of 1's of given it's size
